## Kaggle House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Kaggle competition on predicting house prices. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices based on provided datasets.
You can find the problem here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/simple-housing-price-prediction

## Problem Statement

Kaggle provided three essential files for this competition:
1. `train.csv`: Training data containing house features and prices.
2. `test.csv`: Testing data with features but missing house prices.
3. `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file for the competition.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explore the structure of the provided datasets.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and any data preprocessing steps.

### 2. Model Training
#### 2.1 Linear Regression
- Implement Linear Regression to predict house prices.
  
#### 2.2 Random Forest Regressor
- Train a Random Forest Regressor to capture complex relationships in the data.

#### 2.3 Feature Selection with SelectKBest
- Utilize the SelectKBest method for feature selection.
- Train Linear Regression on the selected features.

### 3. Results and Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression).
- Compare results between Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and SelectKBest + Linear Regression.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ser-kostas/Python-Machine-Learning-House-Prices-Prediction.git
    cd kaggle-house-price-prediction
    ```


2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for a step-by-step walkthrough.

## Results

Include visualizations, insights, and any notable observations from the analysis.

## Future Work

- Suggest improvements or extensions that could enhance the predictive model.
- Identify areas for further exploration or feature engineering.
